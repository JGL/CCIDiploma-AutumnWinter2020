  <div>
    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to our first workshop!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, you'll have done the following things:
    <ul>
      <li>Have gotten to know the structure of the Diploma and this unit by checking out the Unit 1 GitHub</li>
      <li>Signed up for Github.com so you can edit the Unit 1 Wiki and make your own projects</li>
      <li>Signed up for the p5.js forum so you can post to it and be helped and help others</li>
      <li>Signed up for the p5.js editor so you can make new code on the web and share it with others</li>
      <li>Got your Wu-Tang name so you can start your career in Hip-Hop</li>
      <li>Introduced yourself to each other via the Unit 1 Wiki by answering some questions and followed me (@jgl) on Instagram</li>
      <li>Understood why I gave you a Rubber Duck as a present</li>
      <li>Understood why I want you to work in threes in workshops and throughout the Diploma</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    I want you to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020">Unit 1 GitHub if you haven't already</a>. Is there anything that isn't clear? Message me on Slack if you have any questions.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/join">Sign up for GitHub.com</a>. Once you've chosen a username, message me on the CCI Slack with your username so I can add you as a collaborator to the Unit 1 Github. This will enable you to edit the wiki page later with answers to my questions. While you are doing that, a little bonus section about Git and Github.
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development</a>".</li>
      <li>Git is an open source piece of software that lets people all over the world share their code with each other in a way via the internet that allows them to move forward with coding separately, and then merge their different versions into a single piece of software in an organised and trackable way. Git was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> to help with the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a> - another piece of software he originally created. Git is used by most (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Adoption">87.2% in 2018</a>) developers to manage the development of their software.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a startup that makes it easier to use Git on the world wide web. Incidentally, it's owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> who bought it in 2018 for $7.5 billion.</li>
      <li>Let's take a look at GitHub and talk about why it might be useful to make something like Git.</li>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Some time this week, I'd advise taking a look at the frankly brilliant Daniel Shiffman's YouTube playlist:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV">"Git for poets"</a>.</li>
      <li>Here are some other resources for learning about GitHub and Git: <a href="https://try.github.io/">https://try.github.io/</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/">https://guides.github.com/</a>, <a href="[https://help.github.com/en">https://help.github.com/en</a>. </li>
    </ul />
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Incidentally, I'd like to show you how I organise my files on my computer, you might find it useful, it's the result of 20 years of
      <li>First of all, my folder structure - I have a folder for my projects, my records, my research and my personal things. I've got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time Machine</a> working on my Mac, so I'm always backed up and also have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud#iCloud_Drive">iCloud drive</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>In each any of my project/records/research/personal folders, I have a series of named folders describing each individual project.</li>
      <li>In each project folder I have a projectNameWorkRecord.txt and then a series of dated and named folders. The WorkRecord.txt is the diary of every project, with every email and bit of progress dated as it is being done. I also keep a Todo and Done list at the bottom of each file, as well as other important information.</li>
      <li>Each folder is named year_month_date_subject - for example 2019_09_25_WorkingOnLecture3. In this way, when I sort by name, I actually sort by date.</li>
      <li>I do this so I have a written record of the work I've done on anything, in order. This has come in useful in case of disputes about who did what, when.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5js/10">Sign up for the p5.js forum</a>. This will enable you to post questions and projects, get help and help others.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/signup">Sign up for the p5.js editor</a>. This will enable you to write p5.js code on the web and share it with others really easily. This is the way that I recommend you start working in p5.js and also the way that you'll sit the two hour programming exam at the end of the unit.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php">Get your Wu-Tang name, just like Donald Glover did</a>. Then you can start your career in Hip-Hop. Have a discussion of how you think it works. What happens if you put slightly different names in? Same first name and different last names? What is going on under the hood? How is this black box working? Remember <a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/miscellaneous_references/">Jim Campbell's diagram</a>? What is the input and output in this case?
  </div>
  <div>
    Now that you've got your GitHub username and messaged it to me on the CCI Slack, you should be able to <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/wiki/People">edit the people page on our wiki directly</a>. Just copy and paste my answers and add your own. Here are the questions I want you to answer:
    <ul>
      <li>How you want people to address you?</li>
      <li>How you are feeling today?</li>
      <li>What course are you doing at UAL?</li>
      <li>What is your favourite song and muscian at the moment?</li>
      <li>What is your favourite writer and book at the moment?</li>
      <li>Who is your favourte artist at the moment?</li>
      <li>What is your favourite thing to do at the moment?</li>
      <li>What is your Instagram? I'm <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jgl/">@jgl</a> - I follow back! I'm also on TikTok. Are you? Which other platforms should I be on?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Why did I give you a Rubber Duck? Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a> of course! But why is that important? What does Dorey do? What makes it easier to do what Dorey does?
  </div>
  <div>
    Why do I want you to work in threes? Can you think of three reasons? Discuss in your groups.
