    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to read another computer language, C++.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a>.</div>
  <div>I was first made aware of Zach's work when I was introduced to openFrameworks by <a href="https://www.chrisoshea.org/">Chris O'Shea</a>. Zach and I went on to co-found <a href="https://www.yesyesno.com">YesYesNo</a>, along with <a href="https://theowatson.com/">Theo Watson</a>. You'lll hear more about Theo in the next lecture.
