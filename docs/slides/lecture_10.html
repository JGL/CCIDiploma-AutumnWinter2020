  <div>
    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to read another computer language, C++.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a>.</div>
  <div>I was first made aware of Zach's work when I was introduced to openFrameworks (oF) by <a href="https://www.chrisoshea.org/">Chris O'Shea</a>. Zach and I went on to co-found <a href="https://www.yesyesno.com">YesYesNo</a>, along with <a href="https://theowatson.com/">Theo Watson</a>. You'lll hear more about Theo in the next lecture.
  </div>

    <p>A video of Zach talking about his work.</p>
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Zach's work is about introducing people to new technology in a playful way, which is why he's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly that!</div>
  <div>The main thing I want you keep in mind today is oF is just another creative coding framework like p5.js. The base languages are different, (C++ and JavaScript) but the intent is very similar - provide scaffolding to help you make more stuff better, faster and easier.</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about:
    <ul>
      <li>Some projects made with oF</li>
      <li>The Philosphy of oF</li>
      <li>The basics of C++</li>
      <li>The structure of oF</li>
      <li>How to draw with oF</li>
      <li>How OOP works in oF</li>
      <li>Patterns of code in oF</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Some projects made with oF</div>
