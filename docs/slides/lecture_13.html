    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll have thought about what we are going to make together next block, which will be our last block together. )-;</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://alicjakwade.com/">
      Alicja Kwade</a></div>
  <div>I was first drawn to her work by a group exhibition at London's Hayward gallery in 2018 - Space Shifters. Her piece was entitled <a href="https://alicjakwade.com/exhibitions/space-shifters">WeltenLinie</a>. Quoting from her website, the piece took over "almost the entirety of one of Hayward’s lower galleries – nothing is quite what it seems. Using double-sided mirrors and carefully placed, paired objects, the artist achieves the illusion of sudden and surprising material transformations. As we move around and through Kwade’s steel-framed structure, the way we read and understand the objects within it shifts dramatically, depending on our perspective."
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Alicja's work is about time, change and consequences, which is why she's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about:
    <ul>
      <li>LOTS OF THINGS/li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>The main thing I want you keep in mind today is THIS AND THIS</div>
  <div>Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
