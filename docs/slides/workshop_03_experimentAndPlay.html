    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to our third experiment/play session!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, you'll have done the following thing:
    <ul>
      <li>Responded to a series of exercises about Conditional Testing</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Don't worry about trying to complete all the exercises in the next hour or day. You'll get more out of these workshops the more you put in. Try to get into a routine of attempting one or two a day?
  </div>
  <div>
    Message me on the CCI Slack and I'll send you the PDF of exercises for today. Please don't share these PDFs anywhere else.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's start with the series of exercises about Conditional Testing. Don't forget to keep the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js reference open</a> for syntax (the order of things) tips. Remember that it's fine to work in threes on these exercises.
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
