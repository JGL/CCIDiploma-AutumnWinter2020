  <div>CCI Diploma 2020/2021: Unit 1: Lecture 9: Mock Exams.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be alot more relaxed about your Unit 1 examinations.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://www.judychicago.com/about/biography/">Judy Chicago</a>.</div>
  <div>I was first drawn to her work by her piece <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/home">The Dinner Party</a>, which I was lucky enough to see in person in Brooklyn.
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Judy's work is about thinking about how many women have struggled in order for each of us to be here today, which is why she's perfect for today's lecture - all about preparing to mark the end of this particular struggle or journey.</div>
  <div>The main things I want you keep in mind today is that the upcoming assessment is meant to test your knowledge and steady work since the start of the year. I'm not trying to catch you out. All the assessments will be open book, meaning that you can use search enginges and the p5.js website and anywhere else on the internet to help. You must of course complete the work yourself!</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about:
    <ul>
      <li>What to expect from the Unit 1 multiple choice test</li>
      <li>What to expect from the Unit 1 practical exam</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>What to expect from the Unit 1 multiple choice test</div>
  <div>Let's take a look at <a href="https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/pdf/2020_01_20_Unit1MultipleChoiceTest.pdf">last year's multiple choice test</a> and go through it together.</div>
  <div>What to expect from the Unit 1 practical exam</div>
  <div>Let's take a look at <a href="https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/pdf/2020_01_27_Unit1PracticalExam.pdf">last year's practical exam and go through it together</a>.</div>
  <div>Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
