    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to our eighth explore/engage session!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this explore/engage workshop, you'll have done the following things:
    <ul>
      <li>Meditated</li>
      <li>Discussed last week's lectures and workshops</li>
      <li>Reflected on last week's lectures and workshops</li>
      <li>Had bits that you didn't understand or wanted to know more about explained</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's start with a mediation exercise. Which book shall I choose from? You don't have to meditate if you don't want to, but please be quiet and peaceful while I'm reading.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss last week's lectures and workshops. What worked? What didn't? Did you find out anything interesting? Anything I didn't cover that you found for yourself? Have a think and pop any statements into the chat. Message me in private on the CCI Slack if you want to be anonymous.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's reflect on last week's lectures and workshops. Did you have any interesting thoughts or daydreams? Did you look differently at the world? Did you check out any of the other courses or refrences?
  </div>
  <div>
    This is a moment where I can go over things again, or go into more detail. Should I do that?
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
