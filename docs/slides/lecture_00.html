    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Me and my background:</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Born in London, grew up in Wales on a mountain.</li>
      <li>BSc in Maths and Computer Science at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial</a>, MA in Interaction Design at <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/">Royal College of Art</a>.</li>

One year as the <a href="https://universaleverything.com/">Interactive Creative Director of Universal Everything</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/#research">Currently researching Solar-powered mesh based computing and global-scale open source Augmented Reality sculpture</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">CCI</a>?</div>
  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma">Diploma in Creative Coding</a>?</div>
  <div>Why am I proud to be teaching it? I think the Diploma in Creative Computing is the most interesting course that the CCI offers. You are all two years into your undergraduate degrees, you know what you are doing. I'm here to give you knowledge and skills to take back to your final years in whichever department you are in.</div>
  <div>How I'm going to teach and test you in Unit 1: "Creative Coding and Creative Computing Frameworks": let's take a look at the Unit 1 GitHub for more information on how I'm going to teach AND test you (aka the Unit 1 Brief, you'll be getting briefs for each unit you take): <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020">https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020</a> - BTW, this should be the first place you look if you have any questions about unit 1, or the course in general.</div>
  <div>What I'm going to teach you in Unit 1: let's take a look at the <a href="https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/">list of lectures I'm going to be giving up to Christmas</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Up to Christmas, I'm going to teach you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which is <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies">the most commonly used programming language in the world</a>. After Christmas I'm going to teach you <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++, but that's a language for another day.</a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      I'm going to teach you JavaScript using a library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> was specifically designed as a great way for designers, artists and others to learn to code. It was originally created by <a href="http://www.lauren-mccarthy.com/">Lauren McCarthy</a> but now has <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/#contributors">many contributors</a>. p5.js emerged out of another project: <a href="https://www.processing.org/overview/">Processing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Christmas I'm going to teach you C++ using another library, <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, but that's also for another day.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    TLDR: I'm going to teach you creative coding, but also explode some brains along the way with references and concepts outside of creative coding that I think you will find interesting and useful.</div>
  <div>
    BTW, I'm going to reference <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> a lot in this course, because I think it's one of the best things that humanity has ever made, and I wish I'd had it when I was young. Also, it's free - I hated it when teachers would reference books that I couldn't afford when I was at university.
  </div>
  <div>I'd really encourage you to take the time to look at the references I put up throughout these lectures. Think of them as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#Cheat_codes">cheat codes</a> to get you to the next level quicker than I did. A reminder: you are expected to undertake independent study of about 25 hours per week - spread across all the courses you are taking in the Diploma.</div>
  <div>
    I'm going to <b>introduce</b> lots of interesting concepts from many areas so that you know the magic word to search for if you want to know more. Obfuscation is a BIG problem. What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">Obfuscation</a>?
  </div>
  <div>What is creative coding? I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically, creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want to teach you how to write code but also how you could use computing to change your practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Through teaching you creative coding, I want to teach you Computational Thinking. But what is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To teach you see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>teach</b> you to be <b>autodidacts</b>, and, as previously mentioned, to blow your mind <b>at least</b> once per lecture.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up!</div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/JimCampbellFormula_for_computer_art.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/">Jim Campbell</a>'s formula for Computer Art. Realise that you can use things without understanding every aspect of them. All that computers do is process inputs into outputs. That's it.</div>
  </div>
  <div>Important methods for succeeding on this course (and in general)</div>
  <div>So, I'm going to teach you how to code! But much more than that - as mentioned previously, I'm going to teach you different ways of thinking about the universe. I want you to explore thinking in multiple dimensions, how mathematics can help you do that and what dimensions you might want to think in.
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of time?
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of play <b>with</b> the dimension of time?
    <ul>
      <li>Playful history - sampling/remixing?</li>
      <li>Playful now - glitching?</li>
      <li>Playful future - speculative design?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of care <b>with</b> the dimension of time?
    <ul>
      <li>Caring past - history, telling stories truthfully?</li>
      <li>Caring now - repair, upkeep?</li>
      <li>Caring future - sustainability?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    BTW, this idea of play and care as sustainable activities came from a brilliant talk by anthropologist, provocative critic of economic and social inequality and self-proclaimed anarchist <a href="https://davidgraeber.industries/">David Graeber</a> at <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/">amazing annual conference in Germany</a> at the end of 2019: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9S0HD8VH8">"From Managerial Feudalism to the Revolt of the Caring Classes"</a>. Sadly, David Graeber passed away in Venice on September 2nd, 2020. David coined the term "We are the 99 Percent" and the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">Bullshit Jobs</a>.
  </div>
  <div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/Rubber_duck_assisting_with_debugging.jpg" />
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber duck debugging</a> is a very powerful technique. Please ask me for your duck when you finish watching this lecture!</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/designingForPedestriansNotVehiclesByDhiruThadani.png" />
    <div><a href="https://www.dthadani.com/">Dhiru Thadani</a> on thinking about what would happen if we designed for humans - but also that you don't have to make new things, sometimes you just have to rotate what is already there.</div>
  </div>
  <div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/YohjiYamamoto.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohji_Yamamoto">Yohji Yamamoto</a> is right. Copy what you love!</div>

    <div>Just try. As soon as you try you are way ahead of most other people.</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/SusanWendell.jpg" width="66%" />
    <div><a href="http://www.disabilityhistory.org/dwa/library_g.html#wendell">Susan Wendell</a> wrote powerfully about disability and feminism. What explosion of knowledge could you make with your life?</div>
  </div>
  <div>There is a chicken and egg problem with teaching coding, which is that so many parts rely on each other. I've picked an order to teach you over the rest of this term, but I'd really recommend making use of the resources on the next few slides - you won't understand everything right away, but it will help with familiarisation.</div>
  <div>Throughout this course I'm going to use something that I call "Examples orientated teaching". I'm going to spend a lot of time in lectures going through examples, and then re-enforcing that in workshops. Please Slack me with any praise, problems, questions or queries.</div>
