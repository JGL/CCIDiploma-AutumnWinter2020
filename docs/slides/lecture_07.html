  <div>
    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to understand how you can use objects in your code to scale from one interesting thing to whole ecologies of interesting things, reacting to each other.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton">Timothy Morton</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/15/timothy-morton-anthropocene-philosopher">who isn't an artist at all</a>.</div>
  <div>I was first drawn to his work by <a href="https://twitter.com/the_eco_thought/status/714803735470297088">this tweet</a> and his book, <a href=" https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/hyperobjects">Hyperobjects</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Hyperobjects are a "objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium". It really helped me start to think about why we aren't doing anything about global warming and what artists and designers can do about that.</div>
  <div>I think alot of Timothy's work is about what objects are, how they work and what they do in the world - which is why he's perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things! N.B. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology">Object orientated ontology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object orientated programming</a> are not the same thing. But they do use the same word. So there</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about:
    <ul>
      <li>LOTS OF THINGS/li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>The main thing I want you keep in mind today is Power of object orientated is that we can combine data and logic together!</div>
  <div>
    <h3>2. Seymour Papert and Alan Kay.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour Papert</a> was interested in learning theories - especially in how computers could make a difference in how children learn. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> was the first computer language that I encountered as a child - all based around drawing with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)">Turtle</a>.</li>
      <li>Papert pioneered the idea of Microworlds - places where you could safely experiment to think about how to change the future, rather than train children for the jobs of today.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> was inspired by Papert and others and went on to pioneer thinking around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Orientated programming</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing)">Overlapping Window Graphical User Interfaces</a> both at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox Parc</a>.</li>
      <li>Three great talks by Kay: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o">The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmTSpJU-Xc">Normal Considered Harmful</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1R2jH4PQEo">Education That Takes Us To The 22nd Century</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>2. Abstraction and Object-oriented programming.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">Abstraction</a> is a concept that has been applied to many fields, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art">art</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)">computer science</a>.</li>
      <li>Abstraction is a key feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object orientated programming</a>. Object orientated coding allows you to combine logic and data into one place.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> is an example of an object orientated language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a> was one of its predecessors and functional. The ++ means increment, hence C++ being one better than C. (-;</li>
      <li>Let's take a look at the <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">p5.js object orientated examples</a>. Let's start with the <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/objects-objects.html">Objects</a> example.</li>
      <li>There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms">different ways of programming, also known as paradigms</a>.</li>
      <li>Two amusing languages are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)">Whitespace</a>, there are many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">Esoteric languages</a>. (-;</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>3. Fuzzy logic, Computer Vision and Neural Networks.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">Fuzzy logic</a> is a logic where results be other numbers between 0 and 1 - rather than one or the other. It's very useful for controlling systems which are analogue, like a washing machine.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer vision</a> in computer science is the study of making computers able to understand images or video.</li>
      <li>See this <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/10351">Edge.org article on Hidden Layers</a> for an explanation of how biological research directly influenced the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Artifical Neural Networks</a>, a key part of modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l42lr8AlrHk">Computerphile video on what Deep Learning is</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py5byOOHZM8">Another Computerphile video on Convolutional Neural Networks and what makes them SO special</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding">t-SNE</a> is a machine learning technique for collapsing multidimensional data into two or three dimensions - simply put, a great way of visualising a set of images and their relationship to each other.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>3. Fuzzy logic, Computer Vision, Neural Networks, Adam Harvey, Bias and Anti-Facist AI. (continued)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ahprojects.com/">Adam Harvey</a> makes art projects about privacy, computer vision, and surveillance.</li>
      <li><a href="https://digitaltalkingdrum.com/2017/08/15/against-black-inclusion-in-facial-recognition/">Black inclusion in facial recognition</a> by <a href="https://nabilhassein.github.io/">Nabil Hassein</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/digitaliberties/towards-anti-fascist-ai/">Towards an anti-fascist AI</a> by <a href="http://www.danmcquillan.io/">Dan McQuillan</a>.</li>
