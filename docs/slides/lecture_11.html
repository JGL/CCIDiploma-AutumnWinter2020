    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to understand how to use computer vision to make installations beyond the screen.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://www.design-io.com/">Design I/O</a> - which isn't an artist, rather a studio that makes interactive installations, founded by <a href="http://zanyparade.com/">Emily Gobeille</a> and <a href="https://theowatson.com/">Theo Watson</a>.</div>
  <div>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/314115586?color=8bcfb1&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>A few of Design I/O's projects.</p>
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Design I/O's work is about using computer vision in openFrameworks to make amazing experiences, which is why they are perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!</div>
  <div>Show behind the scenes here of connected worlds from vimeo as well as connected worlds, say something about having clever hardware setup, blue screen and IR and the like</div>
  <div>Let's go through <a href="">Golan Levin's</a> <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html">chapter in the ofBook on "Image Processing and Computer Vision"</a>.</div>
  <div>Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
