    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to start every lecture with a promise and an artist to reference.</div>
  <div>I promise that by the end of this lecture you'll be able to understand how to use computer vision to make installations beyond the screen.</div>
  <div>The artist of the day is <a href="https://www.design-io.com/">Design I/O</a> - which isn't an artist, rather a studio that makes interactive installations, founded by <a href="http://zanyparade.com/">Emily Gobeille</a> and <a href="https://theowatson.com/">Theo Watson</a>.</div>
  <div>
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/314115586?color=8bcfb1&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>A few of Design I/O's projects.</p>
  </div>
  <div>I think alot of Design I/O's work is about using computer vision in openFrameworks to make amazing experiences, which is why they are perfect for today's lecture - which is on exactly those things!</div>
  <div>The main thing I want you keep in mind today is that projects that use computer vision are often just as much about how you set up the space in which people will be interacting with your work (expecially lighting) as how you write the software to drive that interaction.</div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, you'll know more about:
    <ul>
      <li>A case study into the Connected Worlds project</li>
      <li>More about Computer Vision and how Computer Vision works in oF</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>A case study into the Connected Worlds project</div>

  </div>
  <div>More about Computer Vision and how Computer Vision works in oF</div>
  <div>Let's go through <a href="http://www.flong.com/">Golan Levin's</a> <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html">chapter in the ofBook on "Image Processing and Computer Vision"</a>.</div>
  <div>Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
