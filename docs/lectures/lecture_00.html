    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Me and my background:</div>
  <div>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">CCI</a>?</div>
  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma">Diploma in Creative Coding</a>?</div>
  <div>Why am I proud to be teaching it? I think the Diploma in Creative Computing is the most interesting course that the CCI offers. You are all two years into your undergraduate degrees, you know what you are doing. I'm here to give you knowledge and skills to take back to your final years in whichever department you are in.</div>
  <div>How I'm going to teach and test you in Unit 1: "Creative Coding and Creative Computing Frameworks": let's take a look at the Unit 1 GitHub for more information on how I'm going to teach AND test you: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020">https://github.com/JGL/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020</a> - BTW, this should be the first place you look if you have any questions about unit 1, or the course in general.</div>
  <div>What I'm going to teach you in Unit 1: let's take a look at the <a href="https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/">list of lectures I'm going to be giving up to Christmas</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Up to Christmas, I'm going to teach you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which is <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies">the most commonly used programming language in the world</a>. After Christmas I'm going to teach you <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++, but that's a language for another day.</a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      I'm going to teach you JavaScript using a library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>. <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> was specifically designed as a great way for designers, artists and others to learn to code. It was originally created by <a href="http://www.lauren-mccarthy.com/">Lauren McCarthy</a> but now has <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/#contributors">many contributors</a>. p5.js emerged out of another project: <a href="https://www.processing.org/overview/">Processing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Christmas I'm going to teach you C++ using another library, <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, but that's also for another day.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    TLDR: I'm going to teach you creative coding, but also explode some brains along the way with references and concepts outside of creative coding that I think you will find interesting and useful.</div>
  <div>
    BTW, I'm going to reference <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> a lot in this course, because I think it's one of the best things that humanity has ever made, and I wish I'd had it when I was young. Also it's free - I hated it when teachers would reference books that I couldn't afford when I was at university.
  </div>
  <div>I'd really encourage you to take the time to look at the references I put up throughout these lectures. Think of them as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_video_games#Cheat_codes">cheat codes</a> to get you to the next level quicker than I did. A reminder: you are expected to undertake independent study of about 25 hours per week - spread across all the courses you are taking in the Diploma.</div>
  <div>
    I'm going to <b>introduce</b> lots of interesting concepts from many areas so that you know the magic word to search for if you want to know more. Obsfucation is a BIG problem. What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">Obfuscation</a>?
  </div>
  <div>What is creative coding? I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want to teach you how to write code but also how you could use computing to change your practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Through teaching you creative coding, I want to teach you Computational Thinking. But what is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To teach you see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>teach</b> you to be <b>autodidacts</b>, and, as previously mentioned, to blow your mind <b>at least</b> once per lecture.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up!</div>
  <div>Important methods for succeeding on this course (and in general)</div>
  <div>So, I'm going to teach you how to code! But much more than that - as mentioned previously, I'm going to teach you different ways of thinking about the universe. I want you to explore thinking in multiple dimensions, how mathematics can help you do that and what dimensions you might want to think in?
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of time?
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of play <b>with</b> the dimension of time?
    <ul>
      <li>Playful history - sampling/remixing?</li>
      <li>Playful now - glitching?</li>
      <li>Playful future - speculative design?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    What about the dimension of care <b>with</b> the dimension of time?
    <ul>
      <li>Caring past - history, telling stories truthfully?</li>
      <li>Caring now - repair, upkeep?</li>
      <li>Caring future - sustainabiliity?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Three things to keep in mind for the whole course:
      <ol>
        <li>Dorey</li>
        <li>Making skateboards</li>
        <li>A rubber duck</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/dory.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Just_Keep_Swimming">What does Dorey do</a>? This is the most important thing in coding.</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/skateBoardNotCar.PNG" />

    <div>In other words, if you want to make a car, make a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bicycle, then a motorbike and THEN a car. I want you to make lots of skateboards this term.</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="content/Rubber_duck_assisting_with_debugging.jpg" />
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber duck debugging</a> is a very powerful technique. Please ask me for your duck when you finish watching this lecture!</p>
  </div>
