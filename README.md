## Code of Conduct

You can find the UAL Disciplinary Code For Students here: [Disciplinary Code For Students](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/student-regulations/disciplinary-code-for-students).

You can find our code of conduct here: [code_of_conduct.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), it was cloned from [https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](the p5.js code of conduct).

[Golan Levin](https://www.flong.com/) also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When communicating, ask yourself:
>
> - T – is it True?
> - H – is it Helpful?
> - I – is it Inspiring?
> - N – is it Necessary?
> - K – is it Kind?

## Block/Term Structure

The [Diploma in Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma) is split into two blocks of teaching. **Block 1** takes up the entire Autumn term and half of the Spring term. **Block 2** follows on, taking the second half of Spring term and the entire Summer term.

**Block 1** consists of three units:

- Unit 1: Creative Coding and Creative Computing Frameworks - taught by me and [Alice Stewart](https://alicestew.art/).
- Unit 2: Introducing Computational Futures and Artificial Intelligence - taught by [Alex Fefegha](https://designcode.art/) and [Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute/people/rebecca-fiebrink).
- [Unit 3: Creative Practice: Visual Coding and Physical Computing](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit3) - taught by [Indira Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indira-k-bb857515b/) and [Alice Stewart](https://alicestew.art/).

In addition, [Vali Lalioti](https://www.theinnovationconsultancy.com/about/) will be supporting the online Diploma cohort for all units.

**Block 2** consists of three units:

- Unit 4: Coding for Collaborative App Development - taught by me and [Alice Stewart](https://alicestew.art/).
- Unit 5: Working and the Digital Creative Industries - taught by [Alex Fefegha](https://designcode.art/).
- Unit 6: Creative Practice: Computational Environments - taught by [Indira Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indira-k-bb857515b/) and [Alice Stewart](https://alicestew.art/).

In addition Vali Lalioti will be supporting the online Diploma cohort for all units.

## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

Please read [UAL's guidance for students on how they will be assessed](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment). [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR): you will be assessed on the following 5 assessment criteria (quoting from [UAL's page](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment)):

1. **Enquiry**
   - Enquiry is about active learning and reflection. It’s how you explore, research and learn about your subject. Enquiry is central to all creative learning at UAL.
2. **Knowledge**
   - Knowledge is about gathering information and enhancing understanding. It’s how you inform your work, explore diverse cultures and connections and appreciate what you do in a wider context.
3. **Process**
   - Process is about your journey of learning. It’s how you take risks and experiment. And how you keep the creative momentum going — developing ideas from start to finish.
4. **Communication**
   - Communication is about telling the story of your learning and making. It’s how you share your learning with an audience, presenting and explaining your work to different people.
5. **Realisation**
   - Realisation is about the work you create and how this reveals what you’ve learned. It’s taking a look back and evaluating the work you’ve produced.

At the end of this block (midway through the 2021 Spring term) you should have the following outcomes, with subheadings for methods and platforms we will use to do so. To be clear, I want you to obtain knowledge and then use that to make projects. My aim is to have every student graduate with new creative computing core knowledge and a portfolio of projects that relate that new creative computing knowledge to their chosen BA subject elsewhere at University of the Arts London (UAL).

### Unit 1 / Block 1: "Creative coding and creative computing frameworks"

1. Code creative computing assets in relevant languages (_Knowledge_, _Process_)

- [JavaScript](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [C++](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++)

2. Understand the use of key frameworks for creative computing (_Knowledge_, _Process_)

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/)

3. Use online tools to collaborate and support your creative computing projects (_Enquiry_, _Communication_)

- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### Teaching Style

I'll be teaching with a [Flipped Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) style. Simply put, I want to spend as much time working through problems and discussing together, rather than you listening to me lecture. Each teaching session will be structured in the following way:

- Hour 1: **Explore/engage** - discuss the previous week's lecture, meditate, reflect, explain.
- Hour 2: **Experiment/play** - work on creative code exercises based on the previous week's lecture, our discussion in the previous hour and excerpts from the upcoming [Code as Creative Medium: An educator's handbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium) by [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/) and [Tega Brain](http://tegabrain.com/).
- Hour 3: **Watch/listen** - absorb a pre-recorded lecture from me, in preparation for next weeks session.

_**You are expected to undertake independent study of 25 hours per week over the three units that you will be taught every block.**_

## Assessment

At the end of Block 1 (halfway through the Spring Term) and at the end of Block 2 (at the end of the Summer Term), you will be assessed individually. The two units I teach (Unit 1 and Unit 4) are assessed in the same way:

Both units will be assessed in the same two ways - via multiple choice test and practical exam. Each part is worth 50% of the unit mark. In the multiple choice test you will be presented with a 20 questions relating explicitly to course content. You must choose between up to 4 potentially correct answers per question. You will be given 1 hour to complete the 20 multiple choice questions. In the Practical Exam you will be individually asked to write a basic program to demonstrate the application of creative coding to a set problem. You will be given 2 hours to complete the Practical Exam.

You can find [last year's Unit 1 Multiple Choice test here](https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/pdf/2020_01_20_Unit1MultipleChoiceTest.pdf) and [last year's Unit 1 Practical exam here](https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/pdf/2020_01_27_Unit1PracticalExam.pdf). You can find [last year's Unit 4 Multiple Choice test here](https://jgl.github.io/CCIDiploma-AutumnWinter2020/pdf/2020_06_01_Unit4MultipleChoiceTest.pdf).

Units 2 and 5 are assessed via an essay.

Units 3 and 6 are assessed via the submission of a 5 minute video and accompanying PDF document.

## Experiment/Play exercises

In addition to the **formal assessment** at the end of **Blocks 1 and 2**, we will be participating in weekly **Experiment/play** workshops. We will discuss and work on the weekly exercises in groups of three on Monday afternoons during the **Experiment/play** hour. The weekly **Experiment/play** exercises won't be assessed, but will be in your interest to complete.

The **Experiment/play** exercises will be based on excerpts from the upcoming [Code as Creative Medium: An educator's handbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium) by [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/) and [Tega Brain](http://tegabrain.com/).

This of idea of small technical exercises was inspired by [Caitlin Morris](http://www.caitlinmorris.net/) and her advice:

> Remind students that technical exercises can be the root of a bigger idea. I’ve had students submit small sketches along with their introductory exercises under the prompt of “if I worked on this for another month/year, what could it become?”. Some really beautiful ideas emerge and I’ve found that it makes students more concept-attentive in their weekly projects, as well as providing some groundwork for larger final projects.

~~Throughout the term, you will be working in pairs. This is a technique known as [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). You may change pair partner as often or sparingly as you like.~~

Following the <a href="https://twitter.com/helenbevan/status/1175650749797167104?s=11">latest research</a>, I've decided to shift us from pairs to threes. After all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np0YIaHv6LQ">three is a magic number</a>.
